Set Up Rust Environment:
Ensure Rust is installed and set up on your Windows machine.
Create a new Rust project using cargo new audio_switcher.
DONE



Integrate Windows API through winapi Crate:
Add winapi crate to your Cargo.toml for accessing Windows-specific APIs.
This crate provides bindings to Windows API, which is essential for interacting with audio devices and Bluetooth status.
DONE



Detect Headset Connection:
Implement a function to check the connection status of the JBL Quantum headset.
You might need to identify the headset based on its Bluetooth ID or device name.
Listen for device connection events instead of constant polling to optimize resource usage.

Audio Device Management:
Implement functions to list audio output devices and set the default audio device.
Utilize Windows Core Audio APIs (part of winapi) to interact with audio devices.
Handle the logic to switch between the headset and loudspeakers based on the headset's connection status.

Build a Background Service:
Structure your application to run as a background service.
Ensure it starts automatically and runs with minimal resource usage.

Testing and Debugging:
Rigorously test the application to ensure it responds correctly to the headset's connection and disconnection.
Pay attention to edge cases, such as the headset disconnecting unexpectedly.

Optimization and Error Handling:
Implement robust error handling, especially for system API calls.
Optimize the application for efficient and reliable performance.

(Optional) User Interface:
If needed, create a simple user interface, possibly in the system tray, for manual control or status indication.

Compilation and Distribution:
Compile the application for Windows.
Optionally, create an installer or distribution package for easy setup by end-users.
